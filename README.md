# AI-Agriculture-Technology-Optimizing-Crop-Yield

## Project Overview

This project leverages **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** techniques to optimize crop yield predictions. By utilizing historical agricultural data, this initiative aims to improve the accuracy of yield forecasts, enabling farmers and agricultural stakeholders to make more informed decisions about planting, fertilization, harvesting, and resource allocation.

## Research Objectives

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gather a comprehensive dataset including weather patterns, soil quality, crop types, and historical yield records.
- **Model Implementation:** Develop multiple ML and DL models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, ANN, CNN, LSTM) to predict crop yields.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compare models using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Optimization:** Enhance model robustness through hyperparameter tuning and techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, and K-Fold Cross Validation.
- **Actionable Insights:** Identify key factors affecting crop yields and provide recommendations for improved resource management.

## Features

1. **Accurate Predictions:** Advanced models trained on diverse datasets to ensure reliable yield forecasting.
2. **Actionable Insights:** Analysis of key factors affecting yields, aiding in strategic decision-making.
3. **Scalable Code:** Modular and reusable Python scripts adaptable to other agricultural contexts.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- **Models Explored:** 
  - Traditional ML: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine
  - Advanced DL: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## Dataset

The dataset used includes:
- **Crops:** 55 unique varieties
- **Features:** Crop Year, Season, State, Area, Production, Fertilizer, Pesticide use, Weather patterns, Soil quality
